# Compare-Area-and-Perimeter

Question Explanation:

This program is written to determine whether the area of a rectangle is less than or equal to its perimeter. It requires two inputs, the length and breadth of the rectangle, and uses these to calculate the area and perimeter.

Logical Approach:

Read Input:
The program first reads two integers from the input, which represent the length and breadth of the rectangle.

Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:
The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula Area = length * breadth. This is stored in the variable area.

Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth). This is stored in the variable perimeter.

Comparison of Area and Perimeter:
The program then compares the area and the perimeter. If the area is less than or equal to the perimeter, it stores True in result; otherwise, it stores False.

Output:
Finally, the program prints the boolean value stored in result. This indicates whether the area of the rectangle is less than or equal to its perimeter.

Example for Clarity:
True


If the input length is 3 and the breadth is 4:
The area of the rectangle is 3 * 4 = 12.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (3 + 4) = 14.
Since the area (12) is less than the perimeter (14), the output is True.
The output will be:
